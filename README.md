## Welcome to Useless Javascript

This is based off of my Useless Java projects, which can be found **[here](https://github.com/racecraftr/UselessJava)**. I remade it into javascript, which is very epic - and also very hard. 

I will try to convert as many `java` projects into `js` projects. I will also include the original java code, as well as the GitHub links to that code.
