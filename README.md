# **Work Experience**

**Smart Beej (Summer 2023 internship)**: Helped to set up microcomputers to manage modular, hydroponics-based farms in India in order to combat the effect of climate change and produce food more sustainably. Tasks involved:

- Discussing and designing remote sensor management frameworks with the core engineering team
- Migrating the on-farm software from a proprietary OS to Amazon Web Services’ Greengrass to manage programs remotely
- Calibrating on-site sensors at farms in India, and developing algorithms to process raw sensor input into actual readings for temperature, humidity, etc.
- Data collection on-device and extraction to cloud-based data warehouse
- Work continued over summer and into the fall of 2023 to get the devices production ready

**Gradzilla (Summer 2024 personal project)**: Created a web application that used generative AI and real-world college data to aid others in the college selection process.
